I am an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a PhD Student in the [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I am working under [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com/) as a member of his lab. My research interests include nonlinear nonparametric variable selection models, shape statistics, and topological data analysis. I expect to graduate in Fall 2023 and plan to pursue a career in data analytics.

While I was born in Boston, MA, I attended high school in North Carolina and Pennsylvania before returning to my New England roots. I graduated with an A.B. in Mathematics with High Honors from the [College of the Holy Cross](https://www.holycross.edu/) in 2017. I also studied abroad my junior year (2015-2016) at [St. Edmund Hall at the University of Oxford](https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/study/visiting-students)Â as a part of the Visiting Students Programme where I earned First XIII colours in women's rowing.
