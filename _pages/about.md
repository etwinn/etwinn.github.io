I am an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a PhD Student in the [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I am working under [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com/) as a member of his lab. I expect to graduate in May 2024 and plan to pursue a career in data analytics.

  <h3> Shape statistics, statistical topology. </h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"> What if the data we want to analyze is not a vector, but a set of shapes? As imaging technology improves in two and three dimensions, I seek to develop and adapt tools from statistics and machine learning to handle shapes. </p>

    <h3> Complex, High Dimensional Data Analysis, Visualization </h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"> Linear regression is a fantastic tool, except when there are a high number of features, and those features have nonlinear relationships. </p>
