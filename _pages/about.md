I am an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a PhD Student in the [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I am working under [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com/) as a member of his lab. I expect to graduate in May 2024 and plan to pursue a career in data analytics.
