# More than Math

Turns out I'm a human beyond my research! 

While I was born in Boston, MA, I attended high school in North Carolina and Pennsylvania before returning to my New England roots. I graduated with an A.B. in Mathematics with High Honors from the [College of the Holy Cross](https://www.holycross.edu/) in 2017. I also studied abroad my junior year (2015-2016) at [St. Edmund Hall at the University of Oxford](https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/study/visiting-students) as a part of the Visiting Students Programme where I earned First XIII colours in women's rowing. 

You may have previously known me as Emily T. Winn, but I hyphenated my name in September 2022. Now, I am Emily T. Winn-Nuñez, both personally and professionally.

I still use my Twitter account at the moment, but I have also become active on other microblogging platforms since then to promote my math and my musings to the largest audience possible. Right now, that includes [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/etwn13.bsky.social) and [Mastodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@etwn). 

While I am a student at Brown University, I live full time in Brooklyn, NY and am completing my PhD remotely, thanks to my advisor's and my department's flexibility and the wonders of the internet. I have an adorable pug, [Yoshi](https://www.instagram.com/yoshi_0shi/)

In 2019, I made an appearance on the [Story Collider podcast](https://www.storycollider.org/stories/2019/12/3/justice-stories-about-righteous-determination), which is a recording of a personal story I told as part of RI Brain Week. I open up about my experience as a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and multi-concussion survivor and the difficulty of seeking justice in the court of law.
